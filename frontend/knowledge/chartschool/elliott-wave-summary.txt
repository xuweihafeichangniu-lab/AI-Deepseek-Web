# Elliott Wave Theory

**Definition**: A form of technical analysis developed by Ralph Nelson Elliott, positing that market price movements follow recurring, fractal patterns driven by investor psychology.

**Core Principles**:
- **5-3 Wave Cycle**: Markets move in an 8-wave cycle consisting of a 5-wave "Motive" (or Impulse) phase followed by a 3-wave "Corrective" phase.
    - **Motive Phase (Waves 1, 2, 3, 4, 5)**: Moves in the direction of the main trend. Waves 1, 3, 5 are expansive/impulsive. Waves 2 and 4 are corrective retracements.
    - **Corrective Phase (Waves A, B, C)**: Moves against the main trend.

**Key Rules**:
1. **Rule 1**: Wave 2 never retraces more than 100% of Wave 1.
2. **Rule 2**: Wave 3 is often the longest and never the shortest of the three impulse waves (1, 3, 5).
3. **Rule 3**: Wave 4 does not overlap with the price territory of Wave 1 (except in rare "diagonal" patterns).

**Fractal Nature**:
The patterns repeat on all timeframes (from minutes to centuries). A completed 5-wave move on a 15-minute chart becomes specific sub-waves of a larger pattern on the 4-hour chart.

**Application in Trading**:
- Traders look for the completion of a corrective phase (e.g., end of Wave C) to enter the main trend.
- Extensions (usually in Wave 3) provide profit targets.
